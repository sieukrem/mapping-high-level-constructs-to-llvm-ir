Virtual Inheritance
-------------------

Virtual inheritance is actually quite simple as it dictates that
identical base classes are to be merged into a single occurrence. For
instance, given this:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class BaseA
    {
    public:
        int a;
    };

    class BaseB: public BaseA
    {
    public:
        int b;
    };

    class BaseC: public BaseA
    {
    public:
        int c;
    };

    class Derived:
        public virtual BaseB,
        public virtual BaseC
    {
        int d;
    };

``Derived`` will only contain a single instance of ``BaseA`` even if its
inheritance graph dictates that it should have two

instances. The result looks something like this:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class Derived
    {
    public:
        int a;
        int b;
        int c;
        int d;
    };

So the second instance of ``a`` is silently ignored because it would
cause multiple instances of ``BaseA`` to exist in ``Derived``,

which clearly would cause lots of confusion and ambiguities.
