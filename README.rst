About
-----

This is a gitbook dedicated to providing a description on how LLVM based
compilers map high-level language constructs into the LLVM intermediate
representation (IR).

This document targets people interested in how modern compilers work and
want to learn how high-level language constructs can be implemented.
Currently the books focuses on C and C++, but contributions about other
languages targeting LLVM are highly welcome. This document should help
to make the learning curve less steep for aspiring LLVM users.

For the sake of simplicity, we'll be working with a 32-bit target
machine so that pointers and word-sized operands are 32-bits. Also, for
the sake of readability we do not mangle (encode) names. Rather, they
are given simple, easy-to-read names that reflect their purpose. A
production compiler for any language that supports overloading would
generally need to mangle the names so as to avoid conflicts between
symbols.
